# Flower Bot

A Discord bot that tells you information about flowers. This bot could be useful for users that want to know general information about flowers. I created this to practice using the Discord API and CMake. I also learned a bit of scientific and biological history while reading about the flowers along the way.

Written in C++ using the D++ (DPP) Discord API.

WIP.
