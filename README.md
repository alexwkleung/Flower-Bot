# Flower Bot

A Discord bot that tells you information about flowers. This bot could be useful for users that want to know general information about flowers. I created this to practice using the Discord API and CMake. I also learned a bit of scientific and biological history about the flowers while creating this bot.

Written in C++ using the [D++ (DPP) Discord API](https://github.com/brainboxdotcc/DPP).

WIP. I will try to add as many flowers as possible to the list of commands. Later on, I'll add more bot enhancements since slash commands alone aren't very exciting.
