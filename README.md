# Flower Bot

A Discord bot that tells you basic scientific information and biological history about flowers. This bot could be useful for users that want to know general information about flowers. I created this to practice using the Discord API and CMake. I myself learned about various flowers while creating this bot, so reading about them can be an interesting read if you're bored.

Written in C++ using the [D++ (DPP) Discord API Library](https://github.com/brainboxdotcc/DPP).

WIP. I will try to add as many flowers as possible to the list of commands. Later on, I'll add more enhancements to make the bot useful and fun.
